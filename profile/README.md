Welcome to the Agentic Community! We are trying to collaboratively understand and develop best practices around agentic
AI. Together, we aim to develop patterns, white papers and reference architectures to help deploy agents both for
testing and production.

To get started, please visit our [community](https://github.com/agentic-community/community/) repository which contains
our charter, discussions, and onboarding material. Below, you will find other repositories that we are developing.
